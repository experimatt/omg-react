This project is a proof-of-concept React version of OMG Transit. It's 100% Javascript and was built using React and Redux.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup

  1. Clone the repo
  2. Make sure you have node installed
  3. run `yarn install` (or `npm`, if you prefer)
  4. get a Google Maps API key and save it as an environment variable
    * i.e. `export REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY={YOUR KEY}`
  5. run `yarn start` to spin up the app
