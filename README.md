This project is an OMG Transit proof-of-concept. It is 100% Javascript and mainly uses React and Redux.

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup

  1. Clone the repo
  2. Make sure you have node installed
  3. run `yarn install` (or `npm install` if you prefer)

    * i.e. `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY={KEY_GOES_HERE}`
